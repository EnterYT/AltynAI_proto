# Neural Network Application

This is a basic neural network application that can be extended to work with Hugging Face models and datasets.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `model/main.py`: Contains the main neural network implementation and training logic
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages

## Features

- Basic neural network implementation with customizable architecture
- Training loop with progress tracking
- Support for GPU acceleration (if available)
- Ready for integration with Hugging Face models and datasets

## Usage

1. The main neural network class (`NeuralNetwork`) can be customized by modifying the architecture in `model/main.py`
2. The `ModelTrainer` class handles the training process with built-in logging and progress tracking
3. To use with Hugging Face models and datasets:
   - Uncomment the example code in the `main()` function
   - Replace "your_dataset_name" with your desired Hugging Face dataset
   - Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters as needed

## Next Steps

1. Add your specific Hugging Face model and dataset
2. Customize the neural network architecture as needed
3. Adjust hyperparameters for optimal performance
4. Add evaluation metrics and validation loop
